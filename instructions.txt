Title: Recipe for Chicken Sandwitch

Ingredients:
    2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
    Salt and pepper, to taste
    1 teaspoon paprika (optional for added flavor)
    2 tablespoons olive oil
    4 slices of your preferred bread (sourdough, whole wheat, etc.)
    Lettuce leaves
    Tomato slices
    Mayonnaise or your preferred sandwich spread
    Cheese slices (optional, like cheddar or Swiss)
    1 tablespoon butter (for toasting the bread)
Chicken Preparation:
    Season the Chicken: Season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and paprika. This simple seasoning adds flavor to the chicken.
    Cook the Chicken: Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken breasts. Cook for 6-7 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is thoroughly cooked and juices run clear. Cooking time may vary based on the thickness of the chicken.
    Rest the Chicken: Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a plate and let it rest for a few minutes. Resting allows the juices to redistribute, making the chicken juicier.
Sandwich Assembly:
    Prepare the Bread: Spread butter on one side of each bread slice. Toast the bread, buttered side down, in a skillet over medium heat until golden brown. This step adds crunch and flavor to the sandwich.
    Spread Mayonnaise: On the non-toasted side of the bread, spread a generous amount of mayonnaise or your preferred sandwich spread. This adds moisture and richness to the sandwich.
    Add the Chicken: Slice the rested chicken breast thinly and layer it over the spread on one slice of bread. Slicing the chicken makes it easier to eat and ensures that every bite is juicy.
    Add Toppings: Place lettuce leaves and tomato slices on top of the chicken. If using, add a slice of cheese. These fresh elements add crunch, moisture, and flavor contrast.
    Close the Sandwich: Top with the second slice of bread, toasted side up, pressing down gently to secure the fillings.
Serving:
    Cut and Serve: Cut the sandwich in half or quarters, depending on preference. Serve immediately while the bread is still warm and crispy.
Notes:
Customization: Sandwich can be customized with with additional ingredients like bacon, avocado, or different spreads (like aioli or mustard) to suit different taste.
